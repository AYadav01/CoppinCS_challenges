# CoppinCS Challenge (Rock, Paper, Scissors)

Problem Statement:
---

Write a program to play the rock-paper-scissor game. Each of the two users types in either R, P, or S.  The program then announces the winner as well as the basis for determining the winner (e.g. Paper covers rock, rock breaks scissors, scissors cut paper, or nobody wins).  The program should allow the players to use lowercase as well as uppercase.

The program should allow each player to enter his/her name.  The playerâ€™s name is displayed with the winning move.

My Solution

* Get the input data and store it in appropriate data type

* The conditions that are to be met are stored in a list

	The list contains a tuple value pair: keyword and message

* Compare the data with the given input using flow control

* Finally output the result
